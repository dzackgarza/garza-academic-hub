In the last year of my undergraduate degree, I did two quarters [^1] of undergraduate
research, and the purpose of this post is to capture some of the research processes and
techniques I pieced together during that time.

One thing that surprised me about research was the sheer amount and breadth of material
one winds up reading, and how often you end up needing piecemeal bits from many
different sources. For example, some of the topics I studied had books with multiple
chapters dedicated to it, whereas others were covered in a single section or even just a
paragraph here and there.
For my level of mathematical maturity, most of the things I needed could be found in
textbooks and occasionally papers and journal articles, but it was sometimes the case
that extended treatments could only be found “off the beaten path” in lecture notes,
expository writings, or theses/dissertations.

It was also surprising how difficult it can be to rediscover any particular result.
An early example of this for me occurred when I began trying to sort out what was known
about the higher homotopy groups of spheres.[^homotopy_wikipedia] [^homotopy_nlab]

I began by churning through many sources resulting from standard keyword searches, not
really knowing which results were significant or not.
At some point, I found a paper that had tabulated the order of many torsion subgroups,
and it was not until many weeks later that I realized that this was a useful thing to
have because it included groups in the “unstable” range.[^stable_homotopy] Going back
and finding that specific document, however, wound up taking much longer than I’d
expected.

As a result, I decided that I needed to set up some kind of system for how I read and
parse papers, textbooks, and other random documents, with the express purpose of making
this kind of “backtracking” slightly less onerous.

Within Mathematics, we are lucky that both LaTeX and the arXiv are the norm, and thus
most research in our field ends up in open access PDFs.
The problem then becomes managing a large number of documents, plus personal notes or
annotations associated with each one, and being able to find these easily later.
This is made difficult by the fact that many people use awful naming conventions for
their documents, and also that some documents lack the OCR layers necessary to search
within them for text.

I thus sought to build some kind of process for how I read, parse, and recollect
information, and came up with the following guidelines/constraints:

1. Documents need to be roughly separated, based on which of these categories they fall
   into:
   1. Textbooks
   2. Published and peer-reviewed papers (e.g. from the arXiv)
   3. Expository notes, lecture notes, and other miscellaneous “unofficial” writing
2. All PDFs should be searchable in some fashion
3. Documents should be imported into some kind of reference management software that
   handles populating metadata, renaming and sorting files, and maintaining a global
   BibTex file.
4. There should only ever be one canonical file for each reference, .e.g. a single PDF
   file
5. Everything needs to sync between my devices (computers and Android phones/tablets) so
   I can read and annotate the same document everywhere
6. Everything needs to be read in something that supports adding notes, annotations, and
   bookmarks.
7. Any annotations and notes put into documents need to be easily searchable, ideally
   providing a quick way to jump directly back to the right spot in the right PDF

Although it required cobbling together several different tools, I’ve managed to land on
a process that roughly meets these criteria, so I’ll try to lay out an outline of what I
settled on.

# Separating Documents

The first step is controlling what is downloaded -– although this requires manually
downloading anything you want to keep, you can at least be assured that everything that
**does** end up on your computer is intentional.

This is useful because not everything I read ends up being relevant -– perhaps I open a
PDF to skim it based on a keyword search on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/archive/math),
which ends up being too far afield to be useful to my particular research project.
In such a case, I would not want such a document mixed in with ones that I’d consider
potentially useful, as it just adds noise.

Fortunately, this is handled pretty well these days by Chrome’s built-in PDF viewer.
I can simply skim papers in the browser, and then manually download anything that looks
promising. Since every PDF file is now an intentional download, I simply drop them into
one of several subfolders as soon as they are downloaded.

Separation by type is important for me because I prefer to use
[Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) to manage textbooks, while I prefer to store
papers and lecture notes separately in [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/). Calibre excels
at populating metadata and cover images for things like textbooks, while Zotero has
nicer organizational capabilities and is particularly good extracting citation
information from *papers* and even expository documents on occasion.

As such, I have one *Books* folder that I set up Calibre to watch, and a second *Papers*
folder for items intended for Zotero.

With Zotero, there is also a
[browser extension for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zotero-connector/ekhagklcjbdpajgpjgmbionohlpdbjgc?hl=en)
which lights up any time you are reading a PDF document.
When clicked, it can send the page directly to a collection of your choice, where it
will create a bibliography entry for it and automatically download the PDF:

![Reading a PDF in-browser, then saving it directly into Zotero using the browser extension.](/assets/images/1549958253593.png)

Since it has a “Watch Folder” feature, it is a relatively simple matter to set it to
watch the *Books* folder for new downloads.

Zotero, on the other hand, I tend to use as an overall organizational tool.
I let it import things like papers and lecture notes, and instead *link* my textbooks
into it. This allows Calibre to continue managing books but also lets me attach them to
research collections, perform searches, extract annotations, etc.

Zotero is slightly unwieldy, but has a handful of killer features that make it worth the
effort:

- Excellent metadata extraction for papers,
- Full-text indexing of all PDFs and annotations
- Maintains a global, automatically updated [BibTeX](http://www.bibtex.org/)) file using
  the [Better BibTeX plugin](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex), and
- Excellent annotation extraction and report generation using the
  [Zotfile plugin](http://zotfile.com/).

Moreover, it has decent internal organizational capabilities using hierarchical
“collections”, which allow aliasing items in many separate places that all reference a
single, canonical source reference and file.

![Zotero's GUI. On the left are a number of collections and subcollections which can be made on the fly; the middle displays associated items; the right displays info about the selected item.](/assets/images/1549958676705.png)

Zotero does not seem to have any “watch folder” features available, and thus requires
either importing via the browser extension manually dragging and dropping files into the
Zotero GUI. In both cases, this copies the document into Zotero’s own internal directory
structure and can be set to automatically begin populating metadata.

It is easy to separately import links to specific textbooks I am working on.
This involves navigating to the proper folder in Calibre, then holding `Ctrl-Shift`
while dragging it into the main collection in the Zotero GUI. This *links* the file,
instead of copying it in and duplicating it.
**This is critical for annotations**, since you always want to be working off of a
single file.

# Syncing Between Devices

This one is also quite easy, I simply store Calibre’s *Library* folder and (separately)
Zotero’s *Library* folder on [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/?landing=dbv2). Syncing
between PCs is then effortless, although setting Dropbox up on Linux can be tricky as it
is controlled through a taskbar/notification icon[^notif_icon]

Syncing to Android devices requires something like
[DropSync](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ttxapps.dropsync&hl=en_US)
to kick off a sync to internal storage or your SD card when files are updated or
changed.

# Reading and Adding Annotations

I generally want a mix of two types of annotation -– the first freehand drawing, since I
occasionally like to color-code things (e.g. to visually distinguish the assumptions of
a theorem from the results).
The second is being able to either highlight chunks of text or add pop-up notes on the
side of the text, both with the intention of being able to digitally search for that
text later.

To this end, I’ve settled on two programs that do the job for now:
[Okular](https://okular.kde.org/) on Linux and
[Moon+ Reader](https://www.moondownload.com/) on Android.

![Okular's default view, with a table of contents on the left.
It supports popup annotations (blue) and highlighting text (yellow), as well as freehand
annotations with a stylus via the toolbar near the
middle.](/assets/images/1549958963489.png)

![Moon+ Reader in landscape view.
Annotations made in Okular show up here and vice-versa.
Great for reading, as phones are quite portable, and includes a bluelight filter to
reduce eyestrain.](/assets/images/moonreader.jpg)

Both have the required annotation capabilities, and additionally, save your view
settings position within a document after it is closed.
Thus when a document is reopened, it immediately jumps to the last page viewed, which is
quite handy. Like most Android applications, Moon+ Reader does not handle stylus inputs
gracefully. However, since annotations need to be made in text to be searchable anyway,
this doesn't detract much from its effectiveness.

Another convenience is that (as far as I can tell) the annotations made with these
applications are actually **attached to the PDF** and show up in other viewers, which
has not been the case with other viewers I’ve tried.

# Annotation Extraction

This is perhaps the crown jewel of this workflow, and at least in my case, makes
building and sticking to a slightly convoluted setup absolutely worth it.

This feature is provided by the combination of Zotero and
[the Zotfile plugin](http://zotfile.com/). Annotations can be extracted from any
individual document, creating an HTML page that contains all highlighted text and all
notes added via pop-up annotations.

What makes this *especially* compelling is that it also includes clickable hyperlinks
which open the associated PDF jump **directly** to the page of that annotation!

![An example of the automatic report that is generated by the "Extract Annotations"
tool. Popup annotations are extracted perfectly; highlighted annotation extraction
depends on OCR quality.

page.](/assets/images/1549959541696.png)

If desired, you can also select a number of documents and create a joint report, which
combines all of the individual reports into a single page.
This can be opened in a local browser window, where the hyperlinks will continue to open
PDFs directly to the referenced page.
You can see an example of what such a report looks like
[here.](/assets/examples/ZoteroReport.html)[^zotero_note] A full description of how to
extract annotations can be found
[here](https://remembereverything.org/manage-pdf-highlights-annotations/).

I can not overstate how useful this is -– if you are diligent about annotating and
highlighting definitions, theorems, results, or problems within the PDFs you read, you
can quickly hit `Ctrl-F` within Zotero to find a term, which will return the extracted
annotation report, which allows you to jump directly into the PDF at the right spot in a
matter of seconds.

Subsequently, since your PDFs are OCR’d, you can easily copy-paste text out of it, or
use something like the [MathPix snipping tool](https://mathpix.com/) to extract LaTeX
for an equation. Since the citation information will already be in your global BibTeX
file, it then becomes easy to simply look up the key and cite appropriately.

# Conclusion

So that’s all there is to it!
It may seem a bit convoluted at first, but for me, it was worth a bit of up-front work
to make information easily retrievable.
This way, when I really get into a bit of Mathematics and need to find or recall a
definition or a proof, I can quickly get to it without getting sidetracked and exhausted
from having to hunt it down.

    problem, see

[^pdfjs_note]: Browser extensions such as Mendeley or Zotero do not currently seem
    compatible with this plugin -– however, with this setup, I’ve rarely needed to
    actually use these connectors.
    When I do need them, it’s easy to disable to PDFViewer plugin temporarily.

[^notif_icon]: Some desktop environments (such as Gnome) are phasing out the entire
    concept of “taskbar icons”, which can be problematic for applications like Dropbox.
    However, there are generally hacks or workarounds that allow such icons to be
    displayed again. [^stable_homotopy]: The unstable groups are notoriously difficult to
    compute; for an overview see
    [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_homotopy_theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_homotopy_theory)

[^zotero_note]: The PDF links are actually opened through Zotero, which passes off a
    file name to your default PDF reader.
    It is thus heavily reliant on the original PDF file's actual location on the
    original file system, so the hyperlinks for one person's reports will almost
    certainly not work for anyone else without some serious coordination.
